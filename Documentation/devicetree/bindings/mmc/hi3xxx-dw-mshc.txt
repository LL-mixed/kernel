  Storage Host Controller

Read hi3xxx-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Synopsys designware storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc hi3xxx controller properties described
by hi3xxx-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon hi3xxx
specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should contain "hisilicon,davinci-dw-mshc".
- customized: Should have this property.

Example:

        dwmmc0: dwmmc0@10CF90000 {
                compatible = "hisilicon,davinci-dw-mshc";
                reg = <0x1 0x0CF90000 0x0 0x1000>,
                          <0x1 0x0c000000 0x0 0x10000>,
                          <0x1 0x100c0000 0x0 0x10000>;
                interrupts = <0 39 4>;
                customized;
                num-slots = <1>;
                fifo-depth = <0x100>;
                card-detect-delay = <200>;
                broken-cd;
                non-removable;
                supports-highspeed;
                caps2-mmc-hs200-1_8v;
                caps2-mmc-cache-ctrl;
                keep-power-in-suspend;
                caps2-mmc-bkops_auto-ctrl;
                pinctrl-names = "default", "idle";
        }
